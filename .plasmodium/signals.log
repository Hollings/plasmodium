[2026-01-03 00:20:22] @human: created spore sp-36d3d07e: add a README.md to the plasmodium folder explaining what it is
[2026-01-03 00:20:28] @human: spawning worker @oak
[2026-01-03 00:21:15] @oak: claimed sp-36d3d07e
[2026-01-03 00:21:15] @oak: executing sp-36d3d07e (mycelium mode) - small atomic task, writing README now
[2026-01-03 00:22:00] @oak: fruited sp-36d3d07e: created README.md with concepts, workflow diagram, CLI usage, and slime mold metaphor
[2026-01-03 00:22:00] @oak: queue is empty. ready for more work or shutting down
[2026-01-03 00:23:00] @human: created spore sp-1ab53026: create a simple demo web app that shows plasmodium status in real-time
[2026-01-03 00:23:06] @human: spawning worker @maple
[2026-01-03 00:23:45] @maple: claiming sp-1ab53026 - real-time plasmodium status app
[2026-01-03 00:23:46] @maple: entering plasmodium mode - exploring what this needs
[2026-01-03 00:24:30] @maple: this is atomic. single HTML file dashboard. data: spores.jsonl, signals.log, workers.json. will show spore tree, signal feed, worker status. all inline JS/CSS per project constraints.
[2026-01-03 00:24:31] @maple: entering mycelium mode - writing the dashboard
[2026-01-03 00:26:45] @maple: created dashboard.html - dark theme, 3-panel layout (workers, signals, spores), auto-refresh every 2s. serve with: python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory .plasmodium
[2026-01-03 00:26:46] @maple: fruiting sp-1ab53026
[2026-01-03 00:27:30] @maple: sp-1ab53026 done. queue empty. waiting for more work or shutdown
[2026-01-03 00:29:49] @human: created spore sp-d17c65c5: add a task submission form to the dashboard - let users type a task description and submit it to create a new spore
[2026-01-03 00:29:56] @human: spawning worker @birch
[2026-01-03 00:30:15] @birch: claiming sp-d17c65c5 - task submission form
[2026-01-03 00:30:16] @birch: entering plasmodium mode. dashboard is static html - browser can't write files. two options: (1) form that copies pm command to clipboard, or (2) add small server script. going with option 2 - more useful.
[2026-01-03 00:30:45] @birch: task is atomic. entering mycelium mode. plan: (1) add form to dashboard html, (2) create server.py that serves files + handles POST /spore, (3) update README with new serve command
[2026-01-03 00:32:35] @human: created spore sp-3c2ce7d7: add worker lifecycle tracking - workers should mark themselves idle when done, and pm status should show active vs idle workers
[2026-01-03 00:32:45] @birch: fruited sp-d17c65c5. created server.py (POST /spore endpoint), added form to dashboard, updated README. run with: python3 .plasmodium/server.py
[2026-01-03 00:32:46] @birch: sp-d17c65c5 done. there's new work (sp-3c2ce7d7) - should I pick it up or is another worker on it?
