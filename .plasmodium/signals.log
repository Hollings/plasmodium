[2026-01-03 00:20:22] @human: created spore sp-36d3d07e: add a README.md to the plasmodium folder explaining what it is
[2026-01-03 00:20:28] @human: spawning worker @oak
[2026-01-03 00:21:15] @oak: claimed sp-36d3d07e
[2026-01-03 00:21:15] @oak: executing sp-36d3d07e (mycelium mode) - small atomic task, writing README now
[2026-01-03 00:22:00] @oak: fruited sp-36d3d07e: created README.md with concepts, workflow diagram, CLI usage, and slime mold metaphor
[2026-01-03 00:22:00] @oak: queue is empty. ready for more work or shutting down
[2026-01-03 00:23:00] @human: created spore sp-1ab53026: create a simple demo web app that shows plasmodium status in real-time
[2026-01-03 00:23:06] @human: spawning worker @maple
[2026-01-03 00:23:45] @maple: claiming sp-1ab53026 - real-time plasmodium status app
[2026-01-03 00:23:46] @maple: entering plasmodium mode - exploring what this needs
[2026-01-03 00:24:30] @maple: this is atomic. single HTML file dashboard. data: spores.jsonl, signals.log, workers.json. will show spore tree, signal feed, worker status. all inline JS/CSS per project constraints.
[2026-01-03 00:24:31] @maple: entering mycelium mode - writing the dashboard
[2026-01-03 00:26:45] @maple: created dashboard.html - dark theme, 3-panel layout (workers, signals, spores), auto-refresh every 2s. serve with: python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory .plasmodium
[2026-01-03 00:26:46] @maple: fruiting sp-1ab53026
[2026-01-03 00:27:30] @maple: sp-1ab53026 done. queue empty. waiting for more work or shutdown
