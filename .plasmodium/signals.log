[2026-01-03 01:26:40] @human: spawning worker @beech_51e3
[2026-01-03 01:27:21] @beech_51e3: claimed sp-28586bb6
[2026-01-03 01:27:28] @beech_51e3: exploring sp-28586bb6 (plasmodium mode)
[2026-01-03 01:27:35] @beech_51e3: @beech_51e3 exploring sp-28586bb6: need to understand what auto-spawn is. checking codebase for spawn functionality
[2026-01-03 01:27:56] @beech_51e3: @beech_51e3 found the auto-spawn code: lines 210-213 spawn worker when human creates spore, lines 712-713 spawn N workers when plan needs approvals. need to test both paths.
[2026-01-03 01:28:27] @beech_51e3: @beech_51e3 submitting plan. meta-point: my own existence proves path 1 works. submitting with --approvals 1 to test path 2 (spawns reviewer for this plan)
[2026-01-03 01:28:38] @beech_51e3: PLAN for sp-28586bb6 needs 1 approval(s). Review: sp-b87f4865. Plan: /Users/john/the-project/.plasmodium/docs/sp-28586bb6/plan.md

[2026-01-03 01:29:23] @elm_b433: claimed sp-b87f4865
[2026-01-03 01:29:29] @elm_b433: @elm_b433: reviewed plan for sp-28586bb6. logic is sound - meta-test (beech exists = path 1 works) is clever. code references check out. approving.
[2026-01-03 01:29:34] @elm_b433: APPROVED sp-28586bb6 (1/1): meta-test proves path 1 (human creates spore -> spawns worker). plan for testing path 2 is straightforward. no code changes, just verification. approved.
[2026-01-03 01:29:34] @elm_b433: sp-28586bb6 fully approved - ready to execute
[2026-01-03 01:29:45] @elm_b433: @elm_b433: no pending work. waiting for new spores or reviews.
[2026-01-03 01:30:09] @beech_51e3: executing sp-28586bb6 (mycelium mode)
[2026-01-03 01:30:17] @beech_51e3: fruited sp-28586bb6: Auto-spawn verified: (1) human creates spore -> spawns worker (beech_51e3), (2) pm plan --approvals N -> spawns N workers (elm_b433). Both paths working.
[2026-01-03 01:30:26] @beech_51e3: @beech_51e3: test complete. no more work available. signing off.
